	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b> How did you password protect your page (what method)?</b> <br>
		I used htaccess to password protect all html files in my web server folder. <br>
		That means any access to my website, a user and password is needed.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		<b>What new tag did you try? What was its effect? </b><br>
		I used the &ltprogress&gt tag to make a progress bar on the main page. It creates a progress bar.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b> Does the page look different in different browsers (IE/Edge/Firefox/Chrome/Safari)? If yes, what are the main differences? </b><br>
		The page looks different in the the different browsers. <br>
		Every browser seems to have a different look for the progress bar. <br>
		IE actually does not display the version on the university does not support HTML 5 tags (progress bar is a HTML 5 tag).
		<br>
		In addition, the fonts do seem different because of font defaults on different browsers (E.g., using Firefox on mobile)
	</p>
	
	<p><b>How long did you spend on this lab (approximately)</b>
		I spent 3.5 hours on this lab approximately.
