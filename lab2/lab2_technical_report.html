		<b> What is your element CSS class?</b> <br>
		My element CSS class was the div.credits class which I used to style my name and student number.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>What is your global CSS class?</b><br>
		My global CSS class was .globStyle which I used on my table to give it a shadow like look along with a custom border look.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>What are your HTML5-only tags? </b><br>
		My HTML5-only tags were the &lt;figure&gt;, &lt;figcaption&gt; (to put a caption on the image), and &lt;mark&gt; (which highlighted the caption).
	</p>
	<p><b>What are your CSS3-only features?</b><br>
		My CSS3-only features were border-radius and box-shadow that I used in my .globStyle class. In addition I used the @font-face style to add a non-standard font in.
	</p>
	<p><b>Did you use the same protection method? If no, what did you use this time?</b> <br>
		I used a more advance version of the same protection this time. It functions exactly like the old one to the user, but is more advance.
		I made the website force HTTPS for the connection because I found out the username and password were sent in plain text with the old htaccess method, thereby making the old authentication unsecure.
		In addition, I made the password into a hash (not really needed). With a HTTPS connection, the username and password responses would be encrypted back to the server.
	</p>
		<p><b>How long did you spend on this lab (approximately)</b> <br>
		I spent around 3 hours on lab2 in total. An hour to boost the security and two hours on the lab.
